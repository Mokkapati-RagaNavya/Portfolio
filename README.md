# Portfolio-website
* The goal was to create a responsive web page describing some design work I have done in the past.

### My main focus for this project
My focus has been directed toward writing readable HTML5 and CSS that would use proper elements, classes and ids, as well as just-enough styling rules that would complement bootstrap and other technologies utilized. This project runs in modern browsers including IE, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Edge.

### Technologies utilized
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for grid-based and responsive design, and image responsiveness
* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) - for material design, paper-card style elements
* [Remodal](http://vodkabears.github.io/remodal/) - for integrating nicely designed modal for each project description
* [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) icons - for nicely designed social icons

### What I learned from this project
* Creating a responsive website
* Creating a  footer
* Playing with media queries for different rendering depending on which device is used and device orientation (portait vs. landscape)
* Ajusting the design according to the project.
* Larnt using new HTML5 tags such as *header*, *aside*, *main*, *section*, *article*, and *footer*.
* Targeting class and ids with regex in CSS
* Creating hover transitions with CSS
* Writing markdown documents
* Properly organizing CSS files (in a logical way)
* Manipulating files with Gulp
